# wowsound
.wow! A sound file format, to be edited in your text editor! Simpler then midi!

For file format info, check wowsound.py

example included, a recreation of "Minecraft" by C148

currently only works on windows due to the "python-beep" library not working on other systems, if anyone else can rewrite the "play_note_hz" function, that would fix this issue but im lazy.

compiled version available [here](https://private.oddcell.ca/wowsound.exe)
